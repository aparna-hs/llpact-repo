(1) The Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, alter any of the provisions contained in any of the Schedules to this Act.

(2) Any alteration notified under sub-section (1) shall have effect as if enacted in the Act and shall come into force on the date of the notification, unless the notification otherwise directs.

(3) Every alteration made by the Central Government under sub-section (1) shall be laid, as soon as may be after it is made, before each House of Parliament, while it is in session, for a total period of thirty days which may be comprised in one session or in two or more successive sessions, and if, before the expiry of the session immediately following the session or the successive sessions aforesaid, both Houses agree in making any modification in the alteration, or both Houses agree that the alteration should not be made, the alteration shall thereafter have effect only in such modified form or be of no effect, as the case may be; so, however, that any such modification or annulment shall be without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done in pursuance of that alteration.
