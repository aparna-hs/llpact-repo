    (a)	shall have power to supervise the carrying out of the compromise or an arrangement; and

    (b)	may, at the time of making such order or at any time thereafter, give such directions in regard to any matter or make such modifications in the compromise or arrangement as it may consider necessary for the proper working of the compromise or arrangement.
