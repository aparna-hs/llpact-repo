    (a)	for the recovery of damages in respect of any fraud, misfeasance or other misconduct in connection with the promotion or formation, or the management of the affairs, of such limited liability partnership or such other entity; or

    (b)	for the recovery of any property of such limited liability partnership or such other entity, which has been misapplied or wrongfully retained,

the Central Government may itself bring proceedings for that purpose.
