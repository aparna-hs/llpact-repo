If any such limited liability partnership is liable to be wound up under this Act or any other law for the time being in force, and it appears to the Central Government from any such report under section 49 that it is expedient to do so by reason of any such circumstances as are referred to in sub-clause (i) or sub-clause (ii) of clause (c) of sub-section (3) of section 43, the Central Government may, unless the limited liability partnership is already being wound up by the Tribunal, cause to be presented to the Tribunal by any person authorised by the Central Government in this behalf, a petition for the winding up of the limited liability partnership on the ground that it is just and equitable that it should be wound up.
